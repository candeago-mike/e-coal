LENS - France
I recently had the chance to visit Lens, a small but fascinating city in northern France, and I have to say—it really surprised me! Known for its coal-mining past, Lens has reinvented itself as a cultural hub, blending history, art, and local charm.

Where to Stay & Getting Around
<<<<<<< HEAD
I stayed at Hôtel Louvre-Lens, a beautifully renovated former mining house that combines modern comfort with the city’s industrial heritage. The city itself is compact, so walking is a great way to explore, but buses and taxis are available too.

If you\'re on a budget, there are plenty of affordable options, like B&B Hôtel Lens Musée du Louvre. Getting to Lens is easy—just over an hour by train from Paris. The city itself is compact, so walking is a great way to explore, but buses and taxis are available too.

Must-See Places
The highlight of my trip was the Louvre-Lens Museum. It’s a smaller, more intimate version of the Louvre in Paris, and I loved how the exhibits were displayed in an open, airy space. Another must-visit is the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, a deeply moving tribute to WWI soldiers. I also made a stop at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, France’s largest war cemetery—standing there really put history into perspective. And for football fans, Stade Bollaert-Delelis is a must! The atmosphere on match days is incredible.

Food to Try
Food in Lens is hearty and delicious. I tried carbonnade flamande, a rich beef stew cooked with beer, and the famous welsh rarebit, which is basically melted cheese heaven! To finish, a slice of tarte au sucre (sugar tart) is a must.

Lens may not be the most famous French city, but it has a unique charm, a rich history, and some truly unforgettable spots. Definitely worth a visit!

PARIS - France

<h1>Paris - France</h1>
<p>Paris is everything you imagine and more! Whether you're strolling along the Seine, admiring world-famous art, or enjoying a coffee in a charming café, the city has an undeniable magic. I spent a few days here and barely scratched the surface of what Paris has to offer.</p>
<h2>Where to Stay & Getting Around</h2>
<p>I stayed at Hôtel des Arts Montmartre, a lovely and affordable option in the artistic Montmartre district. Getting around is easy with the metro—it's efficient and connects all major attractions.</p>
<h2>Must-See Places</h2>
<p>The Eiffel Tower is, of course, a must—especially at night when it sparkles! The Louvre is incredible (don’t just rush to the Mona Lisa, explore other sections too!). I also loved exploring Le Marais, full of small boutiques, cafés, and hidden courtyards. And for a peaceful escape, visit the gardens of the Palais Royal.</p>
<h2>Food to Try</h2>
<p>Paris is a food lover’s dream! I had the most amazing croissant at Du Pain et des Idées. For a classic Parisian experience, try French onion soup at Bouillon Pigalle. And, of course, macarons from Ladurée or Pierre Hermé are a must!</p>
<p>Paris is a city you'll want to return to again and again—there's always something new to discover!</p>

<h1>Lille - France</h1>
<p>Lille is a hidden gem in northern France, often overlooked by travelers, but it has so much charm! With its mix of French and Flemish influences, beautiful old town, and vibrant food scene, it’s a perfect weekend getaway.</p>
<h2>Where to Stay & Getting Around</h2>
<p>I stayed at Hôtel L’Arbre Voyageur, a stylish boutique hotel near the city center. The city is compact, so walking is the best way to explore, but the metro is useful if you need to get somewhere quickly.</p>
<h2>Must-See Places</h2>
<p>The Grand Place is stunning, with its historic buildings and lively atmosphere. I also loved wandering through Vieux-Lille, the old town, with its cobbled streets and colorful Flemish-style houses. Don’t miss the Palais des Beaux-Arts—it’s one of the biggest museums in France and has incredible artwork!</p>
<h2>Food to Try</h2>
<p>In Lille, you have to try carbonnade flamande, a rich beef stew cooked in beer—so comforting! Another specialty is the welsh, a cheesy, beer-infused dish that’s super indulgent. For a sweet treat, grab a gaufre (waffle) from Meert, a historic bakery known for its delicious vanilla-filled waffles.</p>
<p>Lille surprised me in the best way—great food, friendly people, and a relaxed vibe. If you're in northern France, it's definitely worth a visit!</p>

Another hidden gem is the **Monastery of Serra do Pilar**, a UNESCO-listed site with one of the best viewpoints in the region.  
### Food to Try  
Gaia has incredible food, deeply connected to Porto’s culinary traditions. I couldn’t resist trying a **Francesinha**, a hearty sandwich filled with cured meats, covered in melted cheese, and topped with a rich beer-based sauce. Another must-try is **Bacalhau à Brás**, a delicious dish made with shredded codfish, eggs, and potatoes. To pair with a glass of port wine, **Pastel de Nata** (custard tart) is always a perfect choice.  
Vila Nova de Gaia is more than just a place for wine lovers—it’s a city full of culture, history, and unforgettable views. Whether you’re sipping a glass of port or watching the sunset over the Douro, it’s a destination that stays with you long after you leave!

I recently visited **Póvoa de Varzim**, a charming coastal city in northern Portugal, known for its stunning beaches, rich history, and delicious seafood. Located just 30 minutes from Porto, this vibrant town is perfect for a relaxing getaway by the Atlantic Ocean.  

### Where to Stay & Getting Around

For dessert, I enjoyed **Clarinhas de Fão**, sweet pastries filled with pumpkin jam, which are a local favorite.

Sines - Portugal

I recently visited **Sines**, a coastal gem in southern Portugal, known for its stunning beaches, maritime heritage, and connection to the famous explorer Vasco da Gama. Located in the Alentejo region, Sines offers a mix of history, nature, and authentic Portuguese charm.  

### Where to Stay & Getting Around  
I stayed at **Hotel Dom Vasco**, a cozy and elegant hotel with a welcoming atmosphere. Sines is a small town, so walking is the best way to explore, but if you want to visit nearby beaches, having a car is a good idea.  

### Must-See Places  
One of the highlights of Sines is the **Castelo de Sines**, a medieval castle that offers breathtaking views over the Atlantic and a small museum dedicated to Vasco da Gama, who was born here. The **Port of Sines**, one of Portugal’s most important harbors, gives the town a unique mix of industry and tradition. For nature lovers, the **Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park** is nearby, with stunning cliffs, hiking trails, and untouched beaches. Speaking of beaches, **Praia de São Torpes** is a must-visit, especially for surfers.  

### Food to Try  
Sines is a paradise for seafood lovers! I tried **Açorda de Marisco**, a traditional bread-based seafood stew that was rich and full of flavor. Another specialty is **Choco Frito (fried cuttlefish)**, crispy on the outside and tender inside, usually served with a side of fries. To finish, **Sericaia**, a delicious Alentejo-style egg pudding with cinnamon, was the perfect sweet treat.

Łódź - Pologne

I recently visited Łódź, a city in central Poland that completely took me by surprise. Once an industrial hub, it has transformed into a vibrant, culturally rich destination. Historically, it grew around the textile industry in the 19th century and was known for its bustling factories. Today, the city boasts a fascinating mix of old architecture and modern art, reflecting its past while embracing the future.

Accommodation in Łódź is quite affordable compared to other European cities. I stayed at a charming boutique hotel on Piotrkowska Street, the city’s main thoroughfare, which is lined with lovely cafes, restaurants, and shops. Whether you\'re looking for a budget-friendly hostel or a stylish, upscale hotel, there\'s something for everyone.

Getting around the city is easy, with a well-connected public transport system including trams and buses. I found it convenient to use the trams to explore different parts of the city. Taxis and ride-sharing services like Uber are also readily available.

There’s so much to explore here! I highly recommend visiting the Manufaktura, a former textile factory now transformed into a massive shopping and cultural center. Also, the Museum of Art in the former Księży Młyn factory is an absolute must-see for art lovers. The Piotrkowska Street is perfect for a leisurely walk, offering a glimpse into the city\'s history.

When it comes to food, I couldn’t get enough of the local Polish cuisine. I tried pierogi (dumplings), kielbasa (sausage), and bigos (hunter\'s stew), which were delicious and hearty, perfect for refueling after a day of exploring. If you’re visiting Poland, Łódź is definitely a city worth experiencing!

Warsaw - Pologne

I recently spent some time in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and I have to say it exceeded my expectations. The city has an incredible blend of history, modernity, and culture, making it a fascinating place to explore. Warsaw\'s story is remarkable—almost completely destroyed during World War II, the city has been meticulously rebuilt, and you can see this contrast between historical architecture and contemporary design.

<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> cc086fd (populated database with exemples)

Getting around Warsaw was very convenient. The city has an efficient metro system, buses, and trams. I often used the metro to get around quickly, especially since some of the main attractions are spread out across the city.

One of the must-see places is the Old Town (Stare Miasto), which has been meticulously reconstructed after the war. The Royal Castle and the Warsaw Uprising Monument are both significant historical sites. The Wilanów Palace, also known as the "Polish Versailles," is another highlight. For something more modern, I recommend visiting the Warsaw Uprising Museum and the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews—it was incredibly moving and informative.

As for food, Warsaw offers a mix of traditional Polish dishes and international cuisine. I tried pierogi, of course, along with delicious placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes) and a hearty bowl of żurek (sour rye soup). The city’s cafes are also perfect for grabbing a coffee and watching the world go by.

Warsaw truly has something for everyone—whether you\'re a history buff, a foodie, or someone who just enjoys strolling through beautiful streets. It’s a city that’s both historic and dynamic, and I’d highly recommend visiting!

Gdańsk - Pologne

I had the pleasure of visiting Gdańsk, a stunning city on the Baltic Sea in northern Poland, and it quickly became one of my favorite places.

The charming medieval architecture mixed with colorful buildings lining the Motława River made for a picturesque backdrop throughout my visit.

Getting around the city is easy, as it\'s quite walkable. I also used the local trams to explore areas a bit further from the Old Town, and I found the public transport system very convenient. Additionally, the city has a lovely atmosphere with lots of pedestrian-only areas, making it a joy to explore on foot.

There is so much to see here! The Main Town (Główne Miasto) is a must-visit, especially the iconic Long Market and the beautiful Neptune Fountain. The Mariacka Street is another gem, lined with stunning old buildings and amber shops. The Museum of the Second World War is a deeply moving experience and a key part of understanding the city’s complex past. For a beautiful view of the city, I highly recommend a visit to St. Mary’s Church, where you can climb to the top of the tower for panoramic views.

When it comes to food, Gdańsk has a great selection of seafood. I indulged in fresh fish and, of course, tried the local specialty, a hearty bowl of żurek. There are also plenty of cozy cafes where you can enjoy a warm drink and relax after a day of sightseeing.

Gdańsk is a perfect mix of history, culture, and natural beauty. It’s a place that offers a little bit of everything and has a welcoming, laid-back vibe. If you’re ever in Poland, make sure Gdańsk is on your list—it’s a hidden gem!

Dublin - Ireland

I recently had the chance to explore Dublin, the vibrant capital of Ireland, and it was such a fantastic experience! The city has a perfect blend of rich history, lively culture, and a welcoming atmosphere. Dublin may be modern in many ways, but it proudly holds onto its heritage, with historical landmarks scattered throughout the city.

I stayed in a charming hotel just a short walk from Temple Bar, Dublin\'s famous cultural quarter. There are plenty of accommodation options in the city, from cozy guesthouses to chic boutique hotels and even luxurious five-star stays. No matter where you choose to stay, you\'ll find Dublin\'s warm hospitality shines through.

Getting around Dublin was easy, with its extensive bus and tram network (Luas) and plenty of bike rental stations around the city. I loved walking, though, as Dublin is quite compact and pedestrian-friendly. Most of the major attractions are within walking distance, so I spent most of my time strolling through the lively streets.

Dublin has so much to offer, especially for history lovers. I recommend visiting Dublin Castle, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and the iconic Trinity College Library, home to the ancient Book of Kells. The Guinness Storehouse is another must-see, where you can learn about the history of Ireland’s most famous beer and enjoy a pint at the Gravity Bar with a panoramic view of the city.

As for food, Dublin is a true delight for the senses. I had traditional Irish dishes like hearty stew, fresh seafood chowder, and, of course, fish and chips. The city also boasts a thriving food scene, with amazing cafés and pubs offering everything from artisanal pastries to mouthwatering Irish breakfasts.

Dublin is an energetic, diverse city with something for everyone—whether you\'re into history, culture, or just enjoying a pint at a traditional pub. It’s a city full of stories, and I left already planning my next visit!

Most of the major attractions are within walking distance, so I spent most of my time strolling through the lively streets.</p>
<h2>Must-See Places</h2>
<p>Dublin has so much to offer, especially for history lovers. I recommend visiting <strong>Dublin Castle</strong>, the beautiful <strong>St. Patrick’s Cathedral</strong>, and the iconic <strong>Trinity College Library</strong>, home to the ancient <strong>Book of Kells</strong>. The <strong>Guinness Storehouse</strong> is another must-see, where you can learn about the history of Ireland’s most famous beer and enjoy a pint at the <strong>Gravity Bar</strong> with a panoramic view of the city.</p>
<h2>Food to Try</h2>
<p>As for food, Dublin is a true delight for the senses. I had traditional Irish dishes like hearty stew, fresh seafood chowder, and, of course, fish and chips. The city also boasts a thriving food scene, with amazing cafés and pubs offering everything from artisanal pastries to mouthwatering Irish breakfasts.</p>
<p>Dublin is an energetic, diverse city with something for everyone—whether you\'re into history, culture, or just enjoying a pint at a traditional pub. It’s a city full of stories, and I left already planning my next visit!</p>

Belfast - Ireland

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, and I was blown away by how much the city has to offer. Belfast has a fascinating history, once known for its shipbuilding industry (where the Titanic was famously built), and today, it’s a city that blends rich heritage with a vibrant, modern atmosphere.

I stayed in a lovely hotel near the city center, making it easy to explore. Belfast has a great range of accommodations, from budget hostels to stylish boutique hotels, so you’ll find something that suits your taste and budget.

Getting around the city was super easy. I mainly walked, as many of the major attractions are within walking distance, but the public transport system, including buses and the local train network, makes it convenient to travel to other parts of the city and beyond.

There’s so much to see and do in Belfast! One of the highlights for me was the Titanic Belfast, an interactive museum located at the site where the Titanic was built. It’s a moving and informative experience, diving deep into the ship’s construction and tragic sinking. Another must-see is the Giant’s Causeway, which, though a bit outside the city, is an iconic natural wonder worth the trip. In the city itself, you can’t miss the Belfast murals, which tell the story of the city’s political and social history.

When it comes to food, Belfast offers a great variety of local and international options. I had a fantastic traditional Ulster fry (a hearty Northern Irish breakfast) and some freshly caught seafood. The city also has plenty of trendy cafes, pubs, and restaurants where you can try both local and global dishes.

Belfast is a city that has reinvented itself in recent years, offering a unique mix of history, culture, and contemporary life. It’s a fascinating place to visit, and I left with so much appreciation for its resilience and vibrant energy. If you’re ever in Northern Ireland, Belfast is a must!

Galway - Ireland

I recently visited Galway, a lively and charming city on the west coast of Ireland, and it quickly became one of my favorite destinations. Known for its vibrant arts scene, historic streets, and beautiful landscapes, Galway has a relaxed yet energetic vibe that makes it an unforgettable place to explore.

I stayed in a cozy guesthouse near the city center, which gave me easy access to all the sights. Galway has a variety of accommodations, from charming bed-and-breakfasts to boutique hotels and even some luxury options, making it suitable for any type of traveler.

Getting around Galway was easy, as the city is small and pedestrian-friendly. I spent most of my time walking through the colorful streets, enjoying the buskers, street performers, and the local atmosphere. The city also has a great bus system if you want to venture a bit further out.

Galway is full of things to see and do! The Latin Quarter is a must-visit, with its narrow, cobbled streets lined with shops, cafes, and pubs. Eyre Square is another popular spot, and from there, you can easily walk to the Galway City Museum or take a stroll along the River Corrib. I also recommend visiting the nearby Salthill Promenade for a peaceful walk along the coast, with stunning views of Galway Bay.

As for food, Galway is a fantastic place for foodies. I tried some delicious seafood, including fresh oysters from the Galway Bay, and I couldn\'t resist trying a traditional Irish stew. The city is known for its lively pub scene, where you can enjoy a pint of Guinness and listen to live traditional Irish music.

Overall, Galway is a city that blends culture, history, and nature effortlessly. Whether you’re strolling through its lively streets, enjoying a quiet moment by the sea, or indulging in some of the best food Ireland has to offer, Galway truly has something for everyone. It\'s a must-visit when in Ireland!
